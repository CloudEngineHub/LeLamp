# Buidling your own LeLamp

## Electrical Components

![](./assets/schematics.jpg)

A preliminary Bill of Materials (BOM) for LeLamp is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C50qqSxJjCHEnh6j_Dcfx8JzyLlGobKSOYA0ePJUDVk/edit?usp=sharing).

LeLamp is divided into two main sections:

- **Lamp Body** – Houses the mechanical actuation and power conversion systems. This includes:

  - High-torque servos for movement
  - A servo driver board for precise positioning
  - A DC-DC buck converter to regulate 12 V down to 5 V for low-voltage electronics

  Think of the Lamp Body like the human torso—it contains the “muscles” (servos) and “circulatory system” (power delivery) that keep the whole device moving.

- **Lamp Head** – Contains the computing and expressive modules, including:

  - Raspberry Pi Zero 2W for control and connectivity
  - Camera module for vision
  - WS2812B RGB LED ring for expressive lighting
  - Microphone and speaker system for audio interaction

  The Lamp Head is like a human head—it houses the “brain” (Pi), the “eyes” (camera), the “ears” (microphone), and the “mouth” (speaker and LEDs).

You can build a functional LeLamp without most of the head components—or even without the head entirely—if you prefer to control the servos directly from an external computer.
