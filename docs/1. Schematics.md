- **LED ring**: 24x WS2812B programmable LEDs

### 3D Printing Requirements

- **Material**: PLA+ recommended (PETG acceptable)
- **Layer height**: 0.2mm standard, 0.15mm for critical parts
- **Infill**: 20% minimum, 30% for structural components
- **Print volume**: 200x200x150mm minimum printer bed

## Electrical Components

**Complete Bill of Materials**: See [Prerequisites Documentation](./0.%20Prerequisites.md#bill-of-materials) for detailed component list with supplier links.

LeLamp is divided into two main sections:

- **Lamp Body** – Houses the mechanical actuation and power conversion systems. This includes:

  - High-torque servos for movement
  - A servo driver board for precise positioning
  - A DC-DC buck converter to regulate 12 V down to 5 V for low-voltage electronics

  Think of the Lamp Body like the human torso—it contains the “muscles” (servos) and “circulatory system” (power delivery) that keep the whole device moving.

- **Lamp Head** – Contains the computing and expressive modules, including:

  - Raspberry Pi Zero 2W for control and connectivity
  - Camera module for vision
  - WS2812B RGB LED ring for expressive lighting
  - Microphone and speaker system for audio interaction

  The Lamp Head is like a human head—it houses the “brain” (Pi), the “eyes” (camera), the “ears” (microphone), and the “mouth” (speaker and LEDs).

You can build a functional LeLamp without most of the head components—or even without the head entirely—if you prefer to control the servos directly from an external computer.

## 3D Prints

### With Rectangular Lamp Base

In this variation, LeLamp contains 6 3D printed components:

- **1x Lamp Base**: Contains servo driver, speaker and base yaw servo.
- **1x LampArm (Base to Elbow)**: Contains base pitch and elbow pitch servo.
- **1x LampArm (Elbow to Wrist)**: Contains elbow pitch and wrist roll servo.
- **2x LampArm (Wrist to Head)**: Contains base pitch or wrist pitch servo.

You can find the .3mf files for these inside `/3D/`. You can also view it in [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/16c9706360b5ad34f9c8db49/w/2edfa54c83253c120fbc9e58/e/a7196194821d9cfe2842a44a?renderMode=0&uiState=68a066a8be10690aa3429850).
