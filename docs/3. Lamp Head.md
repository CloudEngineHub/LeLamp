# Lamp Head Assembly

**⏱️ Estimated time:** 3-4 hours (including OS setup)  
**🔧 Required tools:** Soldering iron, screwdrivers, heat insert tool  
**📦 Required components:** Pi Zero 2W, ReSpeaker Hat, camera, speaker, LED ring, SD card

![](./assets/schematics.jpg)

LeLamp's head has 4 main functional components:

- **Microphone** - Audio input via ReSpeaker Hat
- **Speaker** - Audio output (4Ω 3W)
- **LED Ring** - 24x WS2812B programmable LEDs for expression
- **Camera** - Pi camera module for vision

All of these components are connected and controlled by a Pi Zero 2W.

## Assembly

Before mounting all components onto the lamp head, it is advised to assemble the electrical components first and test them. You can reference the above image for how this looks like.

### 1. OS

Using [Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), flash **Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit)** onto your Raspberry Pi Zero 2W. You can reference how to do this [here](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html). In this tutorial, we used the Debian Bookworm version (released 2025-05-13).

When prompted to configure the settings on your pi, remember to:

- Set the Wifi SSID and password.
- Set the username and password.
- Set the hostname
- Enable SSH

### 2. Runtime

After successfully flashing your pi, SSH into it by running the following command:

```bash
ssh your_username@your_host_name.local
```

Then you need to set up [LeLamp Runtime](https://github.com/humancomputerlab/lelamp_runtime):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/humancomputerlab/lelamp_runtime.git
```

To use LeLamp's runtime, install uv:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sudo sh
```

To setup the runtime:

```bash
cd lelamp_runtime
uv sync --extra hardware
```

This will take a while.

### 3. Setup Mic and Speaker

If you use the ReSpeaker Hat for Raspberry Pi, you can reference their tutorial [here](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/respeaker_2_mics_pi_hat_raspberry_v2/). For convenience, the tutorial is below:

1. Get Device Tree Source (DTS) for the ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT (V2.0), compile it and install the device tree overlay.

   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seeed-Studio/seeed-linux-dtoverlays/refs/heads/master/overlays/rpi/respeaker-2mic-v2_0-overlay.dts -o respeaker-2mic-v2_0-overlay.dts
   dtc -I dts respeaker-2mic-v2_0-overlay.dts -o respeaker-2mic-v2_0-overlay.dtbo
   sudo dtoverlay respeaker-2mic-v2_0-overlay.dtbo
   sudo cp respeaker-2mic-v2_0-overlay.dtbo /boot/firmware/overlays
   ```

2. Edit /boot/firmware/config.txt:

   ```bash
   sudo tee -a /boot/firmware/config.txt >/dev/null <<'EOF'
   dtoverlay=respeaker-2mic-v2_0-overlay
   dtoverlay=i2s-mmap
   EOF
   ```

3. Reboot your device:

   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

4. Check if your device is enabled:

   ```bash
   aplay -l
   ```

   The expected output should be like this:

   ```bash
   card 2: seeed2micvoicec [seeed2micvoicec], device 0: 1f000a4000.i2s-tlv320aic3x-hifi tlv320aic3x-hifi-0 [1f000a4000.i2s-tlv320aic3x-hifi tlv320aic3x-hifi-0]
   Subdevices: 1/1
   Subdevice #0: subdevice #0
   ```

   Afterwards, you can set up the sound level with the following command:

   ```bash
   alsamixer
   ```

5. Install the necessary dependencies for audio:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
   ```

### 4. Test functionalities

#### Camera

For camera, run the following command:

```bash
libcamera-hello
```

You should expect an output like this:

```bash

```

#### RGB

For RGB, run the following command with sudo:

```bash
sudo uv run -m lelamp.test.test_rgb
```

In case you can't find uv as root, run:

```bash
which uv
```

Then replace uv with the output, for example:

```bash
sudo /home/pi/.local/bin/uv run -m lelamp.test.test_rgb
```

#### Mic and Speaker

For Mic and Speaker, run the following command:

```bash
uv run -m lelamp.test.test_audio
```

#### Servo

Connect Pi Zero 2W to the servo driver through the USB port, then run the following to find which port the servo is connected to:

```bash
uv run lerobot-find-port
```

Then run the following command to check whether the servos are available:

```bash
uv run -m lelamp.test.test_motors --id your_lamp_name --port port_your_servo_driver_is_connected_to
```

Note: There is an error in LeRobot that makes it impossible to be used on Raspberry Pi. Check the status of this error [here](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot/issues/1738).

### 5. Assembly

For reference, this will be what the lamp head will look like. Please reference the schematics in **1. Schematics** while doing this step.

![Lamp Head](./assets/images/5_lamp_head.jpg)

#### ReSpeaker Hat

Prior to mounting, it is recommended to solder headers on the the ReSpeaker Hat. This will help you connect to components as shown in the schematics.

![ReSpeaker Hat](./assets/images/1_lamp_head.jpg)

Then you should put M2 heat inserts into the mounting pads for the ReSpeaker Hat in the lamp head.

Before screwing the hat in, you should route the wires into the hat first. This includes speaker wire, power wire and rgb wire. It should look like this after mounting.

![Lamp Head](./assets/images/2_lamp_head.jpg)

**At this stage, you should plug in the speaker into the JST2.0 input. Unlike the schematics, you should route this outside the lamp head. This is a temporary design compromise for now, since the speaker is too big.**

#### Raspberry Pi Zero 2W

Slide your Micro USB to Type C wire into the lamp head first, then connect it to the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W.

It should look like this:

![](./assets/images/3_lamp_head.jpg)

#### RGB Shield And Camera

![](./assets/images/5_lamp_head.jpg)

You should connect the camera by sliding the camera wire into the camera slit first, then connect to the pi.

You can connect the pi to the RGB shield. This should be easy if you have soldered the headers onto the speaker hat before.
