# Lamp Control

For lamp control, please refer to the [**LeLamp Runtime's Github**](https://github.com/humancomputerlab/lelamp_runtime).

If you have run tests for LeLamp Head earlier, you should be familiar with the runtime.

## Record and replay movements

To record movement, run the following command in runtime:

```bash
uv run -m lelamp.record --id lelamp --port /dev/tty.usbmodem5A680114681 --name rotation
```

To replay movement, run the following command in runtime:

```bash
uv run -m lelamp.replay --id lelamp --port /dev/tty.usbmodem5A680114681 --csv rotation_lelamp_1755265797.csv
```
